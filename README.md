:construction_worker: **Installation**

**You must first have installed [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/) in its 14.20.0 version (I recommend [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) to deal with versions), [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/), and then:**

`git clone https://github.com/WMS-Front-Tests/rubemfsv-fe-test.git`

Passo 1:

`cd rubemfsv-fe-test` - access the project files

Passo 2:

`yarn` (or `npm install`) - to install dependencies

Passo 3:

`yarn dev` - to initialize the project under development

Observations:

`yarn test` - to run jest unit testing

`yarn test:e2e` - to run cypress e2e testing (if you use linux or windows, the command may change because of the \, but you can change the script or run it by `node_modules/.bin/cypress open`)

`yarn start` - to initialize the project under production webpack;

In the package.json file, there are scripts that you can run with node and yarn

:open_file_folder: **Architecture**

The architecture used in this project was the [Clean Architecture](https://dev.to/rubemfsv/clean-architecture-the-concept-behind-the-code-52do), using the concepts proposed by Roberto Martin. To know how to implement this architecture, there is an [article applying this Architecture with React](https://dev.to/rubemfsv/arquitetura-limpa-aplicando-com-react-1eo0) that describes very well the thought line.
